# Tools I Use

## Package Managers

- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) - Chocolatey is a software management solution that allows you to manage 100% of your software, anywhere you have Windows, with any endpoint management tool.
- [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) - A command-line installer for Windows
- [WinGet](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) - Official Windows Package Manager CLI
	- [Winstall](https://winstall.app/) - Bulk install Windows apps quickly with `winget`

I use [alternativeto.net](https://alternativeto.net/) to find new programs to meet my needs, with a priority on open-source software.

## Digital Notes

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) - for organizing thoughts, saving clipped content from the web, building notes for the classes that I teach, building my website. Everything is saved in open markdown format so my notes are not locked into a particular system.
