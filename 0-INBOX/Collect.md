# Collect

## Planning Phase of Collection

1.  List all the places you current collect information:
2.  Determine where in your vault you would like your raw notes to go.
    -   I recommend creating an “inbox” folder in your vault. Your freshly collected notes can sit there to be processed later into the rest of your vault.
3.  Brainstorm 3-5 easy ways to get notes from where you typically collect them to your inbox. Some examples below:
    -   Maybe use your notes app on your phone to take notes while you read a book
    -   Maybe you want to download highlights from your e-reader to your vault once a day or once a week
4.  Pick 1-2 of the ideas you brainstormed in step 3 that you want to start with. Create a simple action plan:

Every time I *placeholder*, I will *action* to store the note in my vault’s inbox.

Here’s an example specific to me: Every time I *finish reading an article online*, I will *open up Obsidian and jot down the main ideas of that article and store the note in my vault’s inbox*.
