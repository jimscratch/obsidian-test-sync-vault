## NextGen Insurance FP&A Capability - PwC Deck PDF Review

[[pwC.deck.pdf]]

- Challenges to Life/Annuity Insurers:
	- Macro-Economic Factors
	- Demographic Shifts affecting top-line growth
	- Shift to a persistent low interest-rate environment eroding returns and creating pressures on the bottom line
	- Regulatory and Accounting changes increasing the complexity of KPIs management uses evaluating business performance
	- Market conditions driving a need to more quickly explain results
	- Historical lack of investment in finance and actuarial functions
	- Insurance trailing other sectors in agility and analytical capabilities to explain and forecast more quickly

**Three Drivers Creating an Immediate Opportunity for Insurers to Enhance their FP&A Capabilities:**

1. The Hood is Already Open: Significant operating model changes are already underway at insurers as they execute their Long Duration Targeted Improvements (LDTI) and International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 17 implementations. Insurers must seize this investment opportunity and enhance FP&A capabilities.
2. LDTI & IFRS 17 Focus More on Value: LDTI and IFRS 17 will result in greater focus from investors on the value underlying insurance business. With this higher level of scrutiny, FP&A must be ready to support the business with strong insights that convey a coherent value driven story.
3. Transformative Technologies: Market leaders are creating a competitive advantage by deploying modern, Cloud-based technologies in finance and actuarial functions. FP&A can build on this to automate, compute faster, and deploy AI-driven analytics to deliver greater insights.

End-to-end architecture enabled by Cloud technology and data automation, including AI/ML techniques, to deliver real-time and advanced analytics and scenario modeling. This requires: 
-  Investment in new technologies to drive automation throughout the organization,
- Deploying innovative techniques to speed up production cycles.

**Notes:**
- PwC's investment in end-to-end architecture enabled by cloud technology and data automation falls directly in my wheelhouse of incorporating experienced, test-driven DevOps pipelines in a production environment, especially in the cloud computing environment.
- Deployment and innovative techniques that speed up production cycles - experience in rapid continuous deployment using technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, K-Native, etc.
- Experience in large, complex system design projects where you must take into account many moving variables and still ensure the project is moving forward at an efficient and sustainable level.
