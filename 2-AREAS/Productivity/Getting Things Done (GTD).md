# Getting Things Done (GTD)

```ad-quote
This consistent unproductive preoccupation with all the things we have to do is the single largest consumer of our time and energy.

## Basic Principles of GTD

GTD is **The Art of Stress-Free Productivity**.

It is a Methodology that teaches you how to:

1. Have more energy
2. Be more relaxed
3. Have more clarity and presence in the moment with whatever you are doing.
4. Get a lot more accomplished with much less effort.

```ad-quote

It is a waste of time and energy to keep thinking about something that you make no progress on.

```

### Five Steps of Mastering the GTD Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
	A[Capture] --> |Collect and Gather Placeholders for ALL the things you consider incomplete, i.e., open loops in your world| B(Clarify)
	B --> | Answer questions like What is it?, Is it Actionable?, and What's the Next Action? |C[Organize]
	C --> | Place in proper bucket so that action can be taken, it is filed away for reference, or to be reminded of it again in the future.| D[Reflect]
	D --> | Regularly review your system, gather and process your stuff, update your lists, and get currrent. | E[Engage]
	E --> | Make good choices about what to work on right now at any point in time. | F[Mind like Water]
```

## Definitions

### Open Loops
```ad-question
title: What is an Open Loop?

Anything considered unfinished, which, if inappropriately managed, consistently engages one's mind ineffiently.

```

### Projects and Next Actions

```ad-question
title: What is a Project?

Any desired result that can be accomplished within a year that requires more than one action step.

```

```ad-question
title: What is a Next Action?

The next physical, viable activity that progresses something toward completion.

```

### Contexts

```ad-question
title: What are Contexts?

The tool, location, or situation in which one will process and action.

```

## The "Wrong" Way to Manage Tasks

Daily to-do lists are not a good approach to task management. Why?

- Hard to nail down to-do items ahead of time due to constant new input and shifting priorities.

- If it doesn't *have* to get done that day, it dilutes the emphasis on the things that truly do.
